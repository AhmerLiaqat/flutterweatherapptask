# flutterweatherapptask
first of all i use visual crossing weather API for weather data because openweather API privede less information as compare to visual crossing API.
In this task i can't show weather icon becasue in visual crossing API we need to donwload icon first and show via assetImage so that's why i doesn,t focus on that.
for searching purpose I use google Map suggesstion API for better result.
For stats management I use Getx approach because I use this approach in many projects.
I used necessory dependencies to do task like geocoding & geolocator for (getcurrent location,to get Address with latitude & longitude,etc) ,get for GetX(stateManagement),flutter_screenutil for responsive app etc.
i know design is not so good but agr figma disgn ho to bilkul same to same figma design ki trah bna sakta hun ....
When you check my code, please let me know what is wrong with my code or what I need to improve or what approaches I can use to make it better.
thanks in advance
